# Highly Skilled Migrants and relocation

Blendle has been a ["recognised sponsor"](https://ind.nl/en/Forms/3084.pdf) by IND sinds 2018. This means we are allowed to employ highly skilled knowledge migrants and relocate them to the Netherlands.

Blendle offers highly skilled migrants a great relocation package and compensations. For the migration and relocation part, Blendle works with [Expat Management Group](https://www.expatmanagementgroup.com/). EMG has a dedicated team involved for the coordination and assistance in immigration, relocation and tax services.

## Blendle Relocation package

- We take care of the work- and residence permits and all the fees (children and spouse included).
- We book the flight(s) to the Netherlands.
- We pay an extra relocation fee to help with the extra expenses.
- We arrange and pay for the first month of temporary accommodation.
- We assist with permanent housing. Like helping with the search, negotiations and settling in.
- We assist with the 30% ruling tax application.

What we offer is flexible and can be adjusted to certain personal needs. But we highly recommend to stick with this all-in-one package to reduce any hassle and stress when relocating to the Netherlands.

### Where to start

We can basically hire anyone from anywhere in the world. But the migration and relocation procedure will be different for some countries. It's good to know that the migration procedure and relocation can take up to 8 weeks. So when interviewing a new candidate, that should be something to be aware of.  The information below should give you a good idea of what the differences are between different countries.

As a lead, if you want to move forward with a candidate and make an offer, please contact HR for support first. In general the procedure looks like something like this:

1. There is a green light after the pair session;
2. Contact HR to discuss the salary, startdate and the relocation offer. In some cases HR needs to contact EMG in advance to check some legal stuff;
3. You have a "yes" from our candidate? HR can take over from here and will start the procedure with EMG;
4. HR will keep you up to date and help you with the on-boarding;
5. HR needs to be up to date about renewals or any other significant changes in salary or contract. These things have consequences for the work permit of our new colleague.
