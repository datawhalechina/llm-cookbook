# Your 1st month

Hey you! Welcome to Blendle. Buckle up, you're in for one hell of a ride :). 

The faster you get settled in the better, so we came up with a structure for your first month to make sure you have a smooth start.

- **Structure 1st month**
    
    Your first month is officially your trial period, which means both parties can terminate the contract if we figure out it is a total mismatch. In Blendle history, this happened once. Your first month is **not** an extended hiring process. As you might have noticed, the hiring process was pretty thorough and you made it through. This means we are pretty sure this is a good match. But, life happens so it's good to have a safeguard like the trial period, just don't feel any extra pressure plz.
    
    - **Before day 1:** your contract is signed and all the administrative stuff is taken care of. After that you got your on-boarding e-mail which probably led you here. This e-mail contains all the basic knowledge and acces codes to get you going.
    - **Day 1:** **Start** around 10:00 (depending on your team, check with them), receive your laptop and Blendle stuff, get settled in (where is the toilet, how does the coffee machine work). Your buddy will get you started in terms of work.

    - **Week 1:** Make sure to **sit down with your lead** in the first few days to get to know each other and talk about expectations [and goals for the 1st month](http://goals.blendle.io/) and the 1st quarter (see below for a structure). Make sure to schedule your week 2 and week 4 check-ins.
    - **Week 2: Have a check-in** regarding expectations and goals. If there are doubts (from both sides): this is the time to say it. If there are severe doubts, think about scheduling another check-in next week (week 3).
    - **Week 4: Have a check-in** regarding expectations and goals. Your trial period ends and you wrap up your first month together. It's important to come up with a few personal goals in this talk. Think about feedback you got and things you would like to achieve, learn or do at Blendle. After this, you will receive continuous feedback and will be involved in the feedback cycle like everyone. This is also a good moment to schedule your weekly or bi-weekly 1on1's with your lead.

- **Template (examples)** for 1st month goals and expectations
    
    Your lead will come up with some goals and expectations, but feel free to add stuff you feel is important. These are **your** goals right :)? So go nuts and alter it if you want.
    
    - **For everybody:** mentality expectations
        
        **This is the mentality we expect from you:**
        
        **Be entrepreneurial -** don't wait, get going and get in execution mode - failing is not a problem, it's only a problem if you don't learn from it. - never failing is a problem though - again: execute, execute, execute. And don't give up after multiple setbacks :)
        
        **See and seize opportunity -** we expect you to see opportunities within Blendle and seize these  - proactively take on other tasks which you feel benefit our company
        
        **Take ownership  -** you are responsible for the end result and targets. As they say within Facebook: "a problem is never someone else's problem", or as phrased within Booking: "See a problem, own a problem" @Jasper Oosterman)
        
        **Focus on impact**  - your work should contribute to your clear deliverables. With everything you do, think about: does this contribute to my main targets?
        
        **Be ambitious -** aim for the highest - we don't ask you to work 80 hours a week, we do ask you to always strive for the best when you are working. A "7" is not good enough.  - be ambitious
        
        If you want to know more about the mentality stuff we find important. Check out The Matrix where we tried to pin down what certain roles look like.

        Hope this creates some clear goals for you. Really looking forward to making this a success!
        
    - Editorial/content
        1. **Create a daily, high quality newsletter**
        
        You probably need some practice, so need to start one week before the actual start of the beta. It's important that we see growth, i.e. "the newsletter is becoming better on a day by day basis"
        
        **2. Hire a team of awesome editors**
        
        Including 1-2 editors from different backgrounds.
        
        Including at least 1 person of whom "you're afraid they might be better at this job than yourself"
        
        **3. Define and execute a winning social media strategy**
        
        Analytics underlying the strategy and "platforms" ready at start of the beta
        
        Optional: chat to other startups to get idea of how they do this
        
        **4. Find good curators**
        
        Involve your lead in how to best get this done - they have a lot of useful connections here.
        
        Find at least 3 curators for every channel in the American kiosk (I'd say: the more the merrier). Rest will be filled by the editorial team.
        
        **5. Manage our community**
        
        Reactions from users on emails of Alexander when beta starts
        
    - Tech
        
        **Week 1: (two days)**
        
        Onboarding, setup laptop, access to npm, GitHub, … Web client/landings running, mainly pairing, reading docs, ...
        
        **Week 2:**
        
        Features - Landing project (Written in TypeScript, not too big code base)
        
        **Week 3:**
        
        Bugs - Web Client (Mainly bugs to come along many places, we’ll collect them…)
        
        ## **Objective: At the end of the month I’m on pace with the team and can pick up Trello cards myself**
        
        The most important thing is to see progress at every milestone (week 2, 3 and 4). Don’t worry if you need time to come up to speed...
        
        **Key results:**
        
        - Shipped **4 features/refactors**
        - Removed **1 painpoint** of the guild. This could be a random failing test or to make the development process better.
